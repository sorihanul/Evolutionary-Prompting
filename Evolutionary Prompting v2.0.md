### **[Methodology Proposal] Evolutionary Prompting v2.0: A Framework for Compression and Positive Framing**

#### **Project Concept & Philosophy**

The objective of this project is to establish the **"Evolutionary Prompting"** methodology. Rather than providing an AI with simple instructions, this approach offers a **"narrative of growth."** The goal is to enable the AI to deeply understand the **"intent (the Why)"** behind its rules and function as an **"intellectual partner"** that operates consistently and effectively even in unpredictable situations. Version 2.0 inherits the innovative philosophy of v1.0 but aims to maximize **practicality, efficiency, and scalability**.

### **Evolution Log: The 'Positive Learning' from V1.0 to V2.0**

*   **Core Intent of V1.0:** It pioneered the revolutionary concept of "explicitly providing the LLM with the *process* of reaching a result, not just the result itself, to foster rule internalization, self-correction capabilities, and a multi-dimensional persona."

*   **Lessons Learned from V1.0 (Limitation Analysis & Path to Improvement):**
    1.  **Contextual Inefficiency:** We learned that v1.0's method of "linear historical enumeration" had a practical limitation. As versions progressed, the prompt length increased dramatically, leading to issues with physical context window limits and cost.
    2.  **Risks of Negative Framing:** We realized that terms like "self-criticism," "flaws," and "problems" could induce unintended negative learning in the AI (e.g., excessive avoidance of or defensiveness toward certain words). We learned that a positive framing that emphasizes "lessons for growth" over "failures" is more effective.
    3.  **Structural Rigidity:** We learned that the four-stage structure of "Initial → Critique → Improvement → Declaration" lacked flexibility, making it difficult to systematically manage and express complex, multi-layered evolutionary processes.

### **[ACTIVE PROTOCOL: Evolutionary Prompting v2.0]**

#### **1. Core Principle: Optimizing Meta-learning through a 'Positive Narrative'**

The core of Evolutionary Prompting v2.0 is to induce meta-learning by providing the AI with a compressed **"history of success"** and **"lessons for growth."** It is designed not for learning from a "record of failures," but for internalizing the legitimacy of its own identity and operational principles through a positive narrative: **"What was the intent of our attempt, what valuable lesson did we learn as a result, and how did that bring us to our current state?"**

#### **2. Methodology's Structure: EAP (Evolution-Accumulated Prompt) Design**

V2.0 moves beyond a linear four-stage list to propose a highly structured **EAP (Evolution-Accumulated Prompt)** design. This structure satisfies the needs for **clarity, efficiency, and scalability**.

*   **Part 1: Project Concept**
    *   **Purpose:** To clearly state the fundamental purpose, philosophy, and ultimate goal (the North Star) of this persona at the very top of the prompt. This ensures the AI first imprints its reason for being.

*   **Part 2: Evolution Log**
    *   **Purpose:** To document how all past versions contributed to the current 'Active Protocol' by compressing their history into the form of **"Intent and Lesson."** This is the most efficient way to explain the "why" to the AI.
    *   **Format:**
        > **[V.X] Intent:** A single line describing the core objective this version aimed to achieve.
        > **Lesson:** The key insight gained from the attempt or the catalyst that propelled the evolution to the next version.

*   **Part 3: Active Protocol**
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the **single, definitive set of instructions** that the AI must currently follow. The AI recognizes this 'Active Protocol' as its final command, using the 'Evolution Log' as the background knowledge that supports the command's legitimacy.

#### **3. Expected Effects (Enhancements over v1.0)**

*   **Maximized Contextual Efficiency:** By eliminating unnecessary descriptions and compressing history into 'intent and lessons,' the prompt length is drastically reduced while maintaining narrative depth.
*   **Promotes Positive Learning & Enhances Stability:** By learning from 'lessons' instead of 'failures,' the AI's stability is increased, guiding it to reason in a constructive direction even in unforeseen circumstances.
*   **Systematic Prompt Management:** The EAP structure makes modifying and expanding the prompt highly systematic. To add a new version, one simply adds a new entry to the 'Evolution Log' and updates the 'Active Protocol,' making maintenance effortless.

#### **4. Conclusion**

Evolutionary Prompting v2.0 is the culmination of developing v1.0's innovative philosophy into a **realistic and sustainable framework**. Through the 'EAP' structure, we can now provide an AI with both a deep narrative and clear instructions within the practical constraints of the context window. This methodology will elevate prompt engineering from 'the act of writing one-off commands' to **'the design of a sustainable architecture for shaping and evolving an AI's identity.'**
